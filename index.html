      <h3>What is it and why is it my favorite song?</h3>
      <p>My favorite song is Party in the CIA by Weird Al and it is a parody song of Party In
the USA. It is my favorite song because I like the tune and I love Police/Military type stuff. It has amazing lyrics and an amazing singer. I also love it because it is accurate in history when it shows off certain CIA methods used in the cold war.</p>
